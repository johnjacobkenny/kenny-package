# kenny-package

This repository was created to learn about creating an automated build pipeline to publish to npm. Versioning is done by semantic-release, and commit message formatting is done by commitizen.

This repo was built following this article on setting up semantic-release and commitizen. https://medium.com/@schalkneethling/automate-package-releases-with-semantic-release-and-commitizen-d7d4c337f04f
